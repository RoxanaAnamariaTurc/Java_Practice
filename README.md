### Project Objectives

This project is part of my continues improvement and development as a Software engineer.
It is a project that is part of the learning path for Java Basics free course from Oracle

### Technologies Used

Java

### Project Approach

Within this repository are two small projects in two separated packages

* Duke Clothing store

* HR App

For the Duke Cloting store I took the following steps

* Created a Clothing class, a Customer class and a Shop class
* Withing the Clothing class I have created private fields for price , tax, description and size
* Also in the clothing class there are setters and getters to help get to the private fields and set those fields based on customer needs
* Also there is a constructor that takes few parameters to help create objects from the Clothing app

* The customer class also holds private fields and methods to help get and set those fields, aswell as methods to help decide what size a customer is based on the input

* There is also the Shop App where the main method is and where the two classes interact with each other

For the HR app I took very similar steps, but instead of clothing and customers I had Employee class and department class
 
### Getting Started

Fork and clone this repository on your local machine
Start changing sizes and run the app

### Project Review

This project helped me to get a better understanding of Java basics and aswell to get the java badge from Oracle

### Potential Next Steps for the Project

This will be a repository where I will continue to work on my java skills going forward with more complex projects
